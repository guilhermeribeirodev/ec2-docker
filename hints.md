### Hints
   
* If you are not familiar with EC2 console and instances, skip the Ubuntu instance creation and install Docker
 on a local machine. The steps are the same. (Almost if you consider the security group ports configuration).
 
* You can do the opposite as well. Just forget Docker and try to create a EC2 instance and play with it.

* Don't waste time trying to execute a command which is not working. Try different alternatives or even start
 from scratch.
 
* Every time you build a Docker image or download from Docker hub that uses space on your disk. You can check
 this running 
 
 `$ sudo docker images`
